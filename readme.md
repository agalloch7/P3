## Project Description

I have created an app using bootstrap and laravel framkework to develop a Develop's Best Friend site, which include two main features, elvish ipsum text generator and random user generators. The site enables users to generate up to 9 paragraphs of text and 100 random users.

## More info

I have used many features on bootstrap for this site such as jumbotron, glyphicons, button-styling, panels, which I think is really fun. And mixing php and html to create the table for random user generator was a bit of a challenge. Both packages I used provided instructions on how to use them, so all I needed to do was to make the route and views, which is not very hard.

## Outside Code
Faker and Lorem Ipsum packages on Packagist.
